"""The Dice Roll Simulation can be done by choosing a random integer between 1 and 6 for which we can use the random module in the Python programming language.
weâ€™ll use the random.randint() function. This function returns a random integer based on the start and end we specify.
The smallest value of a dice roll is 1 and the largest is 6, this logic can be used to simulate a dice roll. This gives us the start and end values to use in our random.randint() function. """
